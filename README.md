2048 Game
Description
This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the player can slide numbered tiles in four directions to combine them and create tiles with larger numbers. The goal of the game is to reach the tile with the number 2048.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the web page and creating the game grid.

CSS: Styled the game elements for a visually appealing interface.

JavaScript: Implemented the game logic and interactivity, including grid management, number generation, movement handling, scoring, and win/lose conditions.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move tiles in the respective directions.
Tiles with the same number merge when moved into each other.
Continue combining tiles and strategizing moves to reach the elusive 2048 tile.
If no more moves are possible or you reach the 2048 tile, the game ends.
Additional Features
Scoring: The player's score is displayed, increasing with each successful merge.

Winning: A message appears when the player reaches the 2048 tile, congratulating them on their victory.

Game Over: If there are no more possible moves, a message appears indicating the end of the game.

How to Restart
Click the "Restart" button to reset the game grid and score. This can be done at any time during the game or after winning or losing.
